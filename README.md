# ThreeInALine
The game that our team implemented using MIPS, is the “Three in a Line” game. The main goal in this game for the user(‘X’) or the computer(‘O’) is to connect three of their icons. The first player to connect their icon wins the game. To win the game, the icons can be connected in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal fashion. The game consists of 3 columns and 6 rows. During a player’s turn, the player enters the number of the column in which they want to place their icon. If the user or computer enters an invalid column number, then the program prints out the appropriate error statement and prompts for another input. After selecting a specific column, Ex: if a player selects column 1, their icon ‘X’ falls to the last available position in the column. Then the computer randomly generates a number from 1 to 3 and places its icon ‘O’ to the last available position in the column generated. This process keeps on continuing till either the player/the computer manages to get three of their icons to connect or the board runs out of empty spaces. If the board runs out of empty spaces, then a tie is called, and the game comes to an end.
